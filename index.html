        Here I try to explore more cases of these gentle out-of-context

      <p>
        A while ago I got to experience this first hand. We moved from India to
        East Coast of the United States. While making this move, we had
        accomodated for the change in climate, food, friends and finally a
        house.
      </p>

      <p>But small things that still made a big difference:</p>

          class="custom-underline"

        The attempt here is to analyze these drawings from a human lense. And by
        doing that, trying to learn how people see their world.

      <p>
        This game challenges players to draw a representation of an object
        within 20 seconds, while the game's neural network tries to recognize
        the drawing in real-time. By collecting drawings from people around the
        world, this AI tries to enhance its ability to understand
        human-generated visual content.

        A Neural Network is a series of algorithms that tries to recognize

        few. The location of people participation is scattered across over 200
        countries. So we have to know where mosst of these drawings are coming
        from.
      </p>

      <p>
        United States has the largest number of drawings. Size of enclosing
        rectangle below represents the drawings from the US. United Kingdom is
        the second highest with a huge gap.

        The data above is skewed. There are also a few other countries apart
        from the ones shown that have very minimalistic numbers. A few up to
        10,000 would be Tunisia, Cyprus, Maldives, Bermuda, but at the extreme
        bottom were less than 20 observations were possible would be Ethiopia,
        Mali, Guinea.

        Not every individual across the world has equal access to the internet.

      <p class="decorated-p">
        But the probability of an individual from a developed country having
        access to internet is higher.

        We don't know what the training dataset for this AI looks like, but it
        seems that to be coming from the most promising version of what would
        happen in a developed country.

      <p>
        So I digged deep into the unrecognized drawings to find stories by
        browsing through these drawings. And to show the variety of meaning, I
        chose 4 house, dishwasher, fan and blackberry.

      <p>A horse for a house?</p>

        To find the reason for a horse showing up from countries such as Egypt,
        Nigeria, Viet Nam and India I went back to the game to find out more.
        Since English is not their native language and the game supports only
        other few, this may be one of the categories that is based on the
        players best guess.

      <p><strong>Stroke Variety</strong></p>

      <p>
        I was compelled to take a step back and look into how the most basic
        shapes are drawn. And there are a variety of ways to do that.
