        Here I try to explore more cases of these gentle out-of-context

        A while ago I got to experience this first hand. We moved from India to
        East Coast of the United States. While making this move, we had
        accomodated for the change in climate, food, friends and finally a
        house.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there is some see it to believe it stuff that made a big difference:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="infographic-container">
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="smallDifferences"></svg>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="story-text">
      <p>
        And this was not it. Initial conversations with my new friends made me
        realize there is a small delta of understanding between what they say
        and what I know.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="decorated-p">
        We had missed taking into account the culture and lifestyle of this new
        place and its people.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so I attempt to explore a doodle dataset from
        <a
          href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/"
          target="_blank"
          class="custom-underline"

        which is the largest published doodle dataset generated as a product of
        one of its AI experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attempt here is to analyze these drawings from a human lense. And by
        doing that, trying to learn how people see their world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game challenges players to draw a representation of an object
        within 20 seconds, while the game's neural network tries to recognize
        the drawing in real-time. By collecting drawings from people around the
        world, this AI tries to enhance its ability to understand
        human-generated visual content.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="decorated-p">
        A Neural Network is a series of algorithms that tries to recognize
        underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics
        the way the human brain operates.

        The data is not represented as the drawing itself. The drawing for each
        category is stored in a (dot)NDJSON format as an array of strokes where
        each stroke is a sequence of x and y coordinates. It represents the
        vector drawing commands to recreate the drawing.

        The data above is skewed. There are also a few other countries apart
